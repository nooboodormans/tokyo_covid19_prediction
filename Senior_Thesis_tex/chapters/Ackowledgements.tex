\section*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Satoshi Inaba, for giving me guidance not only through this thesis but also throughout my academic endeavor during my Bachelor's degree. His extensive support went beyond course work and has especially game me the biggest encouragement during my graduate school applications. It was with his warm words and clear cut advice that I was able to pull through in some of the most hectic times in my life. I would also like to thank Professor Ryuichiro Ishikawa for the guidance of my career path. With his warm kindness, he has supported me through the graduation school application process and gave me advice on my career path even though I was not under his direct supervision. 

I would also like to thank my classmates and friends who made my 4 years in university so fruitful. It was an honor to interact with such great minds and people with diverse backgrounds and aspirations. Without the experience in SILS, I would not have been able to enjoy learning and formulate motivation of extending my knowledge on the vast horizons of academia. 

Above all, I would like to appreciate my family for all the sacrifices for educating and preparing me for my future. Without their unconditional love and support, I would not be here the way I am today. I hope to become myself a person with great love and care to support important people around me.
